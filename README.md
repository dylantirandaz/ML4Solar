# Machine Learning-Based Solar Panel Performance Monitoring and Anomaly Detection

This project leverages IoT sensors and machine learning to monitor the performance of solar panels in real-time. It collects data on voltage, current, and temperature, and uses machine learning to predict performance and detect anomalies. The goal is to provide actionable insights for optimizing solar energy systems and enabling proactive maintenance.

## Features

- **Real-time data collection** from solar panels using a Raspberry Pi.
- **Monitoring of key parameters**: voltage, current, and temperature.
- **Machine learning-based anomaly detection** for identifying faults or inefficiencies.
- **Performance prediction** using regression models.
- **Visualization of data trends** and system efficiency.

## Components Required

- **Raspberry Pi** (any model with GPIO support).
- **Two solar panels or cells** (small-scale, e.g., 5W or 10W).
- **Voltage sensor** (e.g., INA219 or voltage divider).
- **Current sensor** (e.g., INA219 or ACS712).
- **Temperature sensor** (e.g., DHT11 or DHT22).
- **Wires and breadboard** (for circuit connections).
- **SD card** (16GB or more) with Raspberry Pi OS installed.
- **Power supply** (USB-C or micro-USB power adapter).
